How to install opencv(cv2) with python bindings in Linux - Ubuntu/Fedora

  Install gcc, g++/gcc-c++, cmake (apt-get or yum, in case of yum use gcc-c++)

    apt-get install gcc, g++, cmake

    Downlaod latest opencv from openCV's website

    Untar it with

    tar -xvf opencv-*

    Inside the untarred folder make a new folder called release

    mkdir release
    cd release

    (or any folder name) and run this command in it

    cmake -D
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D

    the .. will pull files from the parents folder and will get the system ready for installation on your platform.

    in the release folder run

    make

    After about 2-3 mins of make processing when its finished run

    make install
